Hardware project in Altium with an STM32H7x uProcessor for educational purpose.
This project will use the STM32H7x with a BGA footprint, for educational routing, there is use of an audio codec for external ADC and DAC, but with its onboard ADC and DAC broken out.
A singular or multiple SMPS is to be implemented, following a chip specific design.
